description: How to add Air Framework to your Flutter project.
---

To get started with Air Framework, you need to add the core packages to your Flutter project and install the CLI for the best developer experience.

## 1. Add Dependencies

Add `air_framework` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  air_framework: ^1.0.0
```

For the reactive state management and code generation, add these to your `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  air_generator: ^1.0.0
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

## 2. Install Air CLI

The **Air CLI** is the recommended way to create projects and scaffold modules. Activate it globally using Dart:

```bash
dart pub global activate air_cli
```

## 3. Verify Installation

Run the following command to verify that the CLI is correctly installed:

```bash
air doctor
```

This will check your environment and ensure everything is ready for development.
