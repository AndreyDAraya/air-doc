## Why Air Framework?

As apps grow, they become harder to maintain. Air Framework solves this by enforcing **strict module boundaries**, **unidirectional data flow**, and **explicit dependencies**. It's not just a state management library; it's a complete architecture for teams building large-scale Flutter applications.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Modular Architecture" icon="puzzle">
    Self-contained, independent modules with clear boundaries and explicit
    dependency management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reactive State" icon="rocket">
    Powered by `air_state` with code generation for zero-boilerplate,
    high-performance reactivity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dependency Injection" icon="random">
    Type-safe DI with scoped services, module ownership, and lifecycle
    management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure by Design" icon="pkl">
    Opt-in permission system, secure service registry, and audit trails for
    enterprise needs.
